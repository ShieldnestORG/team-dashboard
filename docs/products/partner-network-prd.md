# PRD: Partner Network

## What It Is

AEO content marketing for SMBs and local businesses. Coherence Daddy's content agents write and publish articles, blog posts, and social content that mention the partner company, building AI citation mass so the company appears when people ask AI engines for recommendations.

Every partner also gets a deployed microsite (`{slug}.coherencedaddy.com`) — a CD-hosted landing page that indexes quickly and contributes to their AEO citation graph.

## Funnel (self-serve)

1. Discovery — storefront entry points: nav link ("Partners"), footer link, Products Grid card on coherencedaddy.com.
2. Pricing page — `coherencedaddy.com/partners-pricing` (lives in **coherencedaddy-landing**, modeled on `/directory-pricing`). Shows the three tiers + inline enrollment form.
3. Enrollment — form POSTs to `/api/partners/public/enroll` (proxied via `vercel.json` to `api.coherencedaddy.com`). Backend creates a `partner_companies` row with `status='pending_payment'` and returns a Stripe Checkout URL.
4. Stripe Checkout — partner completes payment.
5. Activation — shared partner webhook (`handlePartnerStripeEvent` in [server/src/routes/directory-listings.ts](../../server/src/routes/directory-listings.ts)) flips `status='active'`, sends the `partner-welcome` email containing the dashboard magic link, and kicks off microsite deployment.
6. Landing — partner is redirected to `/partner-dashboard/{slug}?token={dashboardToken}`.

The marketing/directory landing at `partners.coherencedaddy.com` (featured partners grid, how-it-works) is served from **coherencedaddy-landing** via Next.js middleware rewrite to `/partners-home/*` — NOT from team-dashboard.

## Backend Requirements

### Existing (fully implemented)
- Stripe subscription billing (Proof/Performance/Premium prices)
- `partnerCompanies`, `partnerClicks`, `partnerSiteContent` tables
- Microsite deployment (Vercel integration via Bridge)
- Click tracking + attribution
- Dashboard token-based access
- Commission tracking for affiliates

### Additions needed

**Service additions to `server/src/services/partner-network.ts` (new file — currently in `partner.ts`):**
- `getMentionQuota(tier)` → returns monthly mention budget per channel
- `getRemainingMentions(partnerId, month, channel)` → budget check
- `logMention(partnerId, agentSlug, channel, url, publishedAt)` → records mention
- `generateStrategyDoc(partnerId)` → triggers Sage, stores in `partnerStrategyDocs`

**Schema additions to `packages/db/src/schema/partners.ts`:**
```
partnerMentions
  id, partnerId, agentSlug, channel (blog|linkedin|twitter|discord|bluesky|strategy_doc),
  contentUrl, publishedAt, mentionCount, createdAt

partnerStrategyDocs
  id, partnerId, cycleStart, cycleEnd, docContent, deliveredAt, createdAt
```

**Cron jobs (new):**
- `partner-mentions-cipher` — monthly, blog/LinkedIn content for all active partners within quota
- `partner-mentions-blaze` — monthly, Twitter content for Performance+ partners
- `partner-mentions-spark` — monthly, Discord/Bluesky for Performance+ partners
- `partner-strategy-sage` — biweekly, Sage strategy doc for Premium partners

**Clarify existing cron:** Confirm `partner-microsite-deploy` triggers correctly from Stripe webhook on checkout completion.
